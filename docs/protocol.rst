The Teleport VR Protocol
########################

The Teleport VR Protocol is a network protocol for client-server immersive applications.
Essentially this means that applications can be used remotely without downloading or installing them.
The protocol is open, meaning that anyone can use it, either by writing a client program or by developing a server that uses the protocol.

Teleport is a top-level application-layer protocol. It can use various means of transport, usually based on the UDP protocol - for example, WebRTC, or the open-source libavstream software.

   * - Teleport VR
     - Real-time client-server interface of a virtual world. 
   * - WebRTC/libavstream/UDP-based transport
     - Any protocol that supports streams and datagrams
   * - Network, Data Link, Physical Layer
     - Standard network layers


Simul provides reference implementations of both client and server.
The protocol and software should be considered pre-alpha, suitable for testing, evaluation and experimentation.

The protocol operates four main connections between a client and server:

+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Service Connection     | Two-way communication between client and server.           |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Video Stream           | A one-way stream of video from server to client.           |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Geometry Stream        | A one-way stream of geometry data from server to client.   |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Static data connection | An http/s connection for data files.                       |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+

In addition, a Discovery connection is used only on connection startup, for new clients to connect to a server.
The Service Connection controls the others and is the main line of information between the client and server.
